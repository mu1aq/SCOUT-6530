"""Detection confidence vs priority score separation.

Detection confidence: how strong is the evidence that a vulnerability exists?
- Static evidence depth (capped by ConfidenceCaps)
- Dynamic evidence (emulation, fuzzing crash)

Priority score: how urgently should an analyst look at this?
- Detection confidence is one INPUT
- EPSS (population-level exploitation likelihood) is another INPUT
- Reachability is another INPUT
- Backport status is another INPUT
- These combine into a separate score, not collapsed into confidence.

Reviewer critique addressed:
> "EPSS additive adjustment makes detection confidence look like a
>  ranking heuristic. They should be separate."

Phase 2B PR #15 -- additive rollout. The ``priority_score`` and
``priority_inputs`` fields are optional on findings; downstream consumers
that only read ``confidence`` continue to work unchanged. New ranking UIs
should read ``priority_score`` instead.

Weights (documented heuristic -- see docs/scoring_calibration.md):
    detection    50%   -- static evidence depth is the anchor
    EPSS         25%   -- population-level exploitation likelihood
    reachability 15%   -- does the vulnerable code touch an exposed surface?
    CVSS         10%   -- severity as a tiebreaker
    backport    -0.20   -- penalty if component shows a distro patch revision

    """Inputs that feed into ``priority_score``, kept for transparency.

    Serialized into ``finding["priority_inputs"]`` so analysts can see

    Attributes:
        detection_confidence: Detection confidence in [0.0, 1.0] -- the
            probability that the finding reflects a real vulnerability.
            Sourced from ``confidence_caps.py`` and must already be capped
            when passed in (the scorer does not re-cap it).
        epss_score: EPSS score in [0.0, 1.0] from FIRST.org, representing
            the probability of exploitation in the next 30 days. ``None``
            when EPSS lookup failed or the API was unreachable.
        epss_percentile: Companion percentile for ``epss_score`` (not used
            in the current weighting but kept for downstream consumers).
        reachability: One of ``"directly_reachable"``,
            ``"potentially_reachable"``, ``"unreachable"``, ``"unknown"``.
            Any other value (including ``None``) is treated as ``"unknown"``.
        backport_present: ``True`` when the component exposes a distro
            patch revision (e.g. ``opkg`` detection method with a non-empty
            ``patch_revision``), indicating the CVE may already be patched
            despite the old upstream version string.
        cvss_base: CVSS v3 base score in [0.0, 10.0] if known, else
            ``None``.
