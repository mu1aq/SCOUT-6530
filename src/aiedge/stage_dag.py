"""Manual STAGE_DEPS dictionary + topological levels.

Single source of truth for stage-to-stage dependencies in SCOUT.
Used by ``run_stages_parallel()`` to compute level-wise execution batches.

STAGE_DEPS is a hand-maintained adjacency list -- every key is a stage name
registered in :data:`aiedge.stage_registry._STAGE_FACTORIES`. The ``findings``
integrated step is intentionally absent because it is not a registered stage
factory; it runs outside the parallel execution path via ``run_findings(ctx)``.

The dependency edges mirror the documented pipeline order in
``.claude/rules/pipeline-architecture.md`` (IPC chain: inventory -> endpoints
-> surfaces -> graph -> attack_surface) and the factory registration order in
``stage_registry.py``.
