Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [3.0.0-rc1] — 2026-05-20

### Added
- **Hybrid Analysis Engine (v3)**: Evolved the core pipeline to handle both ELF binaries and shell scripts simultaneously, bridging the gap between low-level execution and high-level logic.
- **Shell Script Analyzer**: Added `script_analysis` to the registered multi-stage pipeline, providing bounded heuristic coverage for insecure `eval`, backticks, command substitution, and unquoted variable usage in inventory-discovered shell scripts.
- **Inventory Expansion**: Updated `inventory.py` to recursively collect shell scripts (`#!`), expanding visibility into the script-based attack surface while preserving inventory coverage metrics and limitations.
- **Generic Reporting Logic**: Refactored `run.py` to support automatic merging of findings from arbitrary new stages, facilitating a unified view of hybrid threats.
- **AEG-first Exploit RAG package + PoC-in-GitHub seeds**: Split loader/retriever/contamination logic into `src/aiedge/exploit_rag/` and added a metadata-only PoC-in-GitHub importer plus firmware-relevant CVE seed list for curated pattern-card promotion.
- **Pattern-card draft promotion path**: Added `scripts/draft_exploit_pattern_card.py` and `aiedge.exploit_rag.promoter` so unreviewed PoC-in-GitHub candidates can become human-review-required draft cards before any AutoPoC retrieval.
- **Expanded curated RAG corpus contract**: Added explicit `preconditions`, `forbidden_reuse`, and `source_refs` fields to promoted cards and seeded a generic CGI-parameter command-injection pattern for firmware AEG retrieval.
- **AEG E2E gate**: Added `scripts/aeg_e2e_gate.py` plus docs/tests to require real-run AutoPoC pass, reproducible PoC validation, verified-chain isolation, run-level FPR ceiling, and high/critical FP rejection checks before claiming AEG success.

### Verified
- **TP-Link ER605 (v2.2.4) Full Run**:
  - Expanded inventory coverage into **1,334 shell scripts** previously outside the binary-only engine's audit surface.
  - Successfully triaged massive heuristic pattern matches through the registered multi-stage pipeline to identify high-impact, manually verified True Positives (e.g., `ipsec`, `acme.sh` command injections).
  - Confirmed stable merging of hybrid findings into the unified `report.json` without data loss.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Runtime exploit intelligence seeds**: Added the `exploit_intel` stage, Aqua `vuln-list-update`/NVD enrichment, local `AIEDGE_VULN_LIST_DIR` support, and AutoPoC seed loading so CVEs found during a SCOUT run can pull metadata-only public PoC/advisory context without cloning, executing, or prompt-injecting raw public PoC code.
- **Private package lint + hash-only vault registry**: Added `./scout weaponization-package lint|register|verify` and `aiedge.weaponization_package` so private controlled weaponization package manifests can be validated, registered, and scope-checked by package hash before gated execution. The registry stores metadata only and never stores exploit payload source.
- **Gated controlled weaponization executor**: Added `./scout weaponization-execute` and `aiedge.weaponization_execute` to refuse private runner invocation unless Plan IR, preflight, and L6 readiness are valid, then delegate to the existing private plugin runner and write the execution/approval ledger. The wrapper adds product-grade orchestration without adding public payload logic.
- **Controlled weaponization execution ledger + engagement approval gate**: Added `./scout weaponization-ledger` and `aiedge.weaponization_ledger` to aggregate Plan IR, preflight, readiness, exploit-evidence bundles, cleanup proof, and optional `scout-engagement-approval-v1` metadata into L6/L7 promotion records without loading private exploit source.
- **Controlled weaponization Plan IR + preflight gates**: Added `./scout weaponization-plan` and `./scout weaponization-preflight` to lower SCOUT evidence/private package metadata into a bounded SCOUT-W Plan IR and fail closed on scope, firmware identity, chain/pattern binding, safe primitive, preconditions, unknown-target denial, and cleanup requirements before any private executor could run.
- **Controlled weaponization readiness gate**: Added `./scout weaponization-readiness` and `aiedge.controlled_weaponization` to certify private internal red-team packages without loading exploit source. The gate embeds the AEG E2E proof and fails closed unless package metadata is scoped, firmware-hash-bound, safe-primitive-only, cleanup-aware, control-pair validated, and evidence-ledgered.
- **Controlled weaponization documentation for internal red-team product direction**: Added `docs/controlled_weaponization_layer.md` and synchronized README/runbook/AEG/RAG/PoV docs to clarify that SCOUT's product target includes authorized, private, scope-bound weaponization promotion after reproducible PoV and fail-closed pair evidence. Public raw PoC cloning/execution and unknown-target weaponization remain non-goals.
- **Synthetic AEG vulnerable/control pair**: Added `scripts/run_aeg_synthetic_pair.py` and tests that execute the real AutoPoC runner, `poc_validation`, `verified_chain`, and FP/FPR gate against a local vulnerable service and patched/control service. The vulnerable case must pass; the patched/control case must fail closed as FP evidence.
- **Command-injection synthetic pair profiles**: Extended the synthetic AEG pair harness to validate `cgi_param_cmd_injection` and `config_derived_cmd_injection`, including RAG reference selection and patched/control fail-closed behavior.
- **Exploit Pattern evidence gate**: Added `memory_stateful_probe` as the first synthetic-pair-validated RAG card plus `scripts/check_exploit_pattern_evidence.py` to report which curated pattern cards have vulnerable/control evidence and which still need real pair validation.
- **Pattern pair evidence recorder**: Added `scripts/record_pattern_pair_evidence.py` and `aiedge.exploit_rag.pair_evidence` so real known-vulnerable/patched firmware runs can be validated through the AEG E2E gate before updating pattern-card `validation_evidence`.

## [2.8.0] — 2026-05-18

### Added

- **Exploit Pattern RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Introduces a metadata-backed reference retrieval layer for channel-aware stateful AutoPoC generation.
    - **Knowledge Base**: Structured patterns stored in `data/exploit_references/` including JSON metadata, exploit reasoning, and reference PoC samples.
    - **Scoring Retriever**: Multi-axis matching engine that selects the best-fit patterns based on vulnerability family, input channels (Web, Config, IPC), sink types (popen, system), and trigger models.
    - **Adaptation-First Prompting**: LLM instructions optimized to treat references as "tactical patterns" rather than code to be copied. Enforces a two-step output: Adaptation Plan followed by Python Code.
    - **Reference Contamination Guard**: Automated verification logic that detects and blocks target-specific artifacts (endpoints, IPs, product names) from references leaking into generated PoCs.
    - **RAG Metadata Recording**: Attempt artifacts now include `rag_references` and score breakdown for full auditability.

### Fixed

- **v2.8.0 release gate close-out**: synchronized `aiedge.__version__` with `pyproject.toml`, pinned RAG retriever/prompt/contamination guard tests, and kept RAG verification wording within lab-only `vulnerability_trigger` PoV semantics.

- **RAG-Induced Hallucination**: Reduced target-agnostic endpoint copying by sanitizing the few-shot prompt to exclude full reference source code and enforcing strict adaptation contracts.
- **Channel Mapping Alignment**: Standardized `config_file` vs `config` channel taxonomy between the dossier scanner and RAG retriever.

## [2.7.3] — 2026-05-18

### Added

- **Universal Chaining outbound response-chain quality pass** (`src/aiedge/exploitability_dossier.py`, `src/aiedge/exploit_state_machine.py`, `src/aiedge/exploit_autopoc.py`, `src/aiedge/poc_templates.py`, `docs/er605_poc_quality.md`). SCOUT now generalizes the ER605 analysis process into product-agnostic outbound client response-parser chain modeling: dossier detection emits `outbound_protocol_response_parser` candidates with `lab_network_redirection`, `protocol_response`, `parser_field`, and `leak_before_control_boundary` channels; state-machine lowering preserves families and uses `classify_outbound_response_chain_quality`; AutoPoC avoids duplicate candidate IDs across dossier/state-machine sources and can synthesize protocol-aware Plan IR; the deterministic template is exploit-first but lab-bounded: it sends a short benign response PoV packet only to the configured lab target and returns `vulnerability_trigger` success only when response/readback evidence is observed; it still avoids overlong fields, ROP, command payloads, crypto/key recovery, and spoofing infrastructure.

- **Phase 2D' Step C.4 — `private_exploits/` override + `AIEDGE_AUTOPOC_MAX_CANDIDATES`** (`src/aiedge/exploit_autopoc.py`, `tests/test_exploit_autopoc_stage.py`, `private_exploits/chain-cred-mgmt-takeover.py`, `docs/pov/2026-04-24_r7000_verified.json`). The verdict machinery (`scripts/build_verified_chain.py::_status_3_of_3` + `src/aiedge/reporting.py::_compute_run_verdict`) was already wired for `VERIFIED` but had no legitimate path to reach it: the LLM/template autopoc generators emit `proof_type in {"tcp_banner", "service_reachability", "static_artifact_read"}`, none of which satisfy the runner's `_ALLOWED_PROOF_TYPES = {"shell", "arbitrary_read", "arbitrary_write"}` gate. New: an analyst-authored plugin dropped at `<repo_root>/private_exploits/<chain_id>.py` overrides the generator entirely; `exploit_autopoc` records `generator=private_exploits` / `generator_reason=private_plugin_override` on the attempt. Because `_status_3_of_3` demands `len(attempts) == 3` across all chain_dirs combined, the new env var `AIEDGE_AUTOPOC_MAX_CANDIDATES` caps candidate selection (set to `1` to isolate a single chain). First reference plugin targets `chain-cred-mgmt-takeover` and performs an unauthenticated read of R7000's `/currentsetting.htm`. End-to-end PoV demo against a synthetic R7000 httpd produced `verified_chain.verdict.state = "pass"` with `["isolation_verified", "repro_3_of_3"]` and `analyst_digest.exploitability_verdict.state = "VERIFIED"` / `["VERIFIED_ALL_GATES_PASSED", "VERIFIED_REPRO_3_OF_3"]`; full evidence snapshot at `docs/pov/2026-04-24_r7000_verified.json`.

### Fixed

- **Phase 2D' Step C.3b — `PoCResult.proof_evidence` dict tolerance** (`exploit_runner.py`, `tests/test_exploit_runner.py`). With the C.3 module-load fix applied, end-to-end replay of the R7000 plugin revealed a second crash: `_sanitize_paths` threw `TypeError: expected string or bytes-like object, got 'dict'` because the LLM-generated plugins declared `proof_evidence: Dict[str, Any]` in direct violation of the `PoCResultLike` Protocol (which specifies `str`). Runner now coerces non-string `proof_evidence` values to a JSON string via `_coerce_proof_evidence`; the `readback_hash=<value>` token survives the coercion so `poc_validation._validate_poc_reproducibility`'s whitespace-tokeniser can still extract it. Regression test `test_exploit_runner_tolerates_dict_proof_evidence` uses the exact `Dict[str, Any]` shape the R7000 LLM emitted. End-to-end verification against the archived R7000 plugin now writes all three attempts into `evidence_bundle.json` (previously: 0 attempts, empty directory, inconclusive verdict).

- **Phase 2D' Step C.3 — `exploit_runner.py` plugin-load crash on Python 3.12+ dataclasses** (`exploit_runner.py`, `tests/test_exploit_runner.py`). In the 2026-04-13 R7000 run, every LLM-generated PoC plugin (all three: `chain-cred-mgmt-takeover`, `chain-cred-ota-persistence`, `chain-default-credential-fleet`) failed to load with `[FAIL] private_plugin_load_failed: 'NoneType' object has no attribute '__dict__'`, leaving `exploits/chain_*/evidence_bundle.json` empty and blocking `poc_validation._validate_poc_reproducibility` from ever observing a readback_hash. Root cause: `_load_module_from_path` did not register the dynamically-loaded plugin in `sys.modules` before calling `spec.loader.exec_module`. Python 3.12+ `dataclasses._is_type` resolves forward references via `sys.modules.get(cls.__module__).__dict__`; with the module absent, `.get()` returned `None` and `.__dict__` crashed during `@dataclass` expansion. Because LLM-codegen'd plugins routinely define a local `@dataclass PoCResult` (rather than importing it from `poc_skeletons.interface`, which the test fixture happened to use), this bug was invisible to the existing test matrix. Fix: register the module in `sys.modules` before `exec_module` and roll back the registration on load failure so retries start clean. New regression test `test_exploit_runner_loads_plugin_with_local_dataclass` exercises the exact shape the R7000 LLM emitted. Unrelated pre-existing ruff F841 warnings for unused `stderr_bytes` in `_capture_pcap` are cleaned up in the same hunk.

- **Phase 2D' Step C.2 — `docker/scout-emulation/` tier-1 contract repair** (`docker/scout-emulation/Dockerfile`, `docker/scout-emulation/entrypoint.sh`, `docker/scout-emulation/build.sh`, `docker/scout-emulation/README.md`, `tests/test_docker_scout_emulation.py`). The v1.0.0 scaffold had three defects that made the Tier-1 emulation path unusable: (a) `entrypoint.sh` ended the auto mode with `./run.sh ... || echo "FirmAE boot failed, try qemu-user"`, which always returned 0 (echo succeeds), so `aiedge.emulation._try_tier1` — which keys purely off `docker run`'s returncode — would mark FirmAE boot successful even on silent failure. The entrypoint now propagates FirmAE's exit code directly (`exit $?`) and documents a 0/1/2/3 contract in the file header. (b) `FIRMAE_COMMIT` was a placeholder 40-char string that did not resolve against `pr0v3rbs/FirmAE`; it now pins `4030f2421b2432ff1d3ddb6fe0fc40296ff53dbf` (master HEAD as of 2026-04-24). (c) a redundant `psycopg2-binary` pip install layered on top of apt's `python3-psycopg2` has been dropped; only `coloredlogs` is still installed via pip (with `--break-system-packages` fallback for PEP 668 images). `build.sh` now surfaces the resolved image tag and allows `FIRMAE_COMMIT` override. New `README.md` documents the build budget (1.5-2 GB image, 20-40 min first build), the exit-code contract, and the `--privileged` rationale. Five new pinning tests in `tests/test_docker_scout_emulation.py` prevent regressions: full-length SHA, no `|| echo` masking, contract comments, image-tag parity with `EmulationStage._resolve_emulation_image()`.

- **Phase 2D' Step C.1 — `poc_validation` prereq topological order + path robustness** (`src/aiedge/stage_dag.py`, `src/aiedge/poc_validation.py`, `tests/test_poc_validation_stage.py`, `tests/test_stage_dag.py`). In the 2026-04-13 R7000 run, `poc_validation` finished at `10:14:39 UTC` with `failed` / `POLICY_PREREQ_STAGE_ARTIFACT_MISSING` even though `stages/exploit_chain/milestones.json` existed — because it existed 2h40m *after* poc_validation ran. Root cause: `STAGE_DEPS["poc_validation"]` listed only `exploit_autopoc`, so a parallel (or subset) rerun could schedule poc_validation while `exploit_chain` was still pending, and the stage's prereq check would observe a transiently missing `milestones.json`. Fix: (a) `STAGE_DEPS["poc_validation"]` now requires both `exploit_autopoc` and `exploit_chain`, closing the DAG gap that the prereq check always implied. (b) `poc_validation` now uses `.resolve().is_file()` so symlinked or relative run_dir prefixes resolve correctly. (c) The blocked `note` now enumerates the specific missing paths (`"Required exploit-stage artifacts are missing: <path1>, <path2>"`) instead of a generic message, so analysts can see which upstream stage to rerun. New pinning tests: `test_poc_validation_missing_prereq_note_lists_paths`, `test_poc_validation_resolves_run_dir_symlinks`, `test_stage_deps_poc_validation_requires_exploit_chain`.

## [2.7.2] — 2026-04-24

Detection-engine integrity patch. Two follow-ups from the v2.4.0 external
review (`docs/upgrade_plz.md`) that were partially addressed in v2.4.1 but
left cosmetic residues. No change to pair-eval scorecard is expected:
Gap B was runtime-effective since v2.4.1, and Gap C's confidence ceiling
only binds on the `decompiled_colocated` taint method, which is emitted
exclusively by the pyghidra fallback path (`ghidra_analysis.py:609`) that
Ghidra-12-enabled environments do not exercise. The Phase 2D' Entry Gate
scorecard therefore remains the v2.7.1 figure of record (**2/5 PASS**).

### Changed

- **Phase 2C++.1 — `DECOMPILED_COLOCATED_CAP` separated from inline literal** (`confidence_caps.py`, `taint_propagation.py`, `tests/test_confidence_caps.py`, `docs/confidence_semantic_break_v2.6.md`). The `decompiled_colocated` taint method previously hardcoded a `0.50` ceiling in-line; confidence_caps now exposes `DECOMPILED_COLOCATED_CAP = 0.45` as part of a five-tier cap ladder (`SYMBOL_COOCCURRENCE < DECOMPILED_COLOCATED < STATIC_CODE_VERIFIED < STATIC_ONLY < PCODE_VERIFIED`). Consumer impact: `decompiled_colocated` traces drop `0.50 → 0.45` (-0.05); `priority_score` weights and `STATIC_CODE_VERIFIED_CAP=0.55` (cve_scan) unchanged. ROC thresholds previously pinned at 0.50 should be retuned to 0.45 to preserve pre-v2.7.1 recall. Rationale: the v2.4.0 external review (`docs/upgrade_plz.md` Gap C) flagged the prior value as over-confident relative to the body-text-only evidence it represents; the new value reflects evidence-level parity with `SYMBOL_COOCCURRENCE` (0.40) plus +0.05 because decompilation exposes inlined CALLs absent from symbol tables.

### Fixed

- **Phase 2C++.2 — legacy `addr_diff > 16` residues removed** (`ghidra_analysis.py`, `ghidra_scripts/pcode_taint.py`, `tests/test_ghidra_dead_code_removed.py`). The v2.4.0 external review (`docs/upgrade_plz.md` Gap B) flagged a byte-offset heuristic in P-code taint CALL matching. Commit `3352783` (v2.4.1, 2026-04-11) replaced that primary path with callee-name resolution via `_resolve_call_target()` but left two residues: a standalone `trace_pcode_forward()` helper inside `_PYGHIDRA_SCRIPT` that was never invoked (dead within the script), and an unreachable `else: addr_diff = abs(...)` fallback in `ghidra_scripts/pcode_taint.py` protected only by `if source_api_name:` (and `run()` always passes `source_api_name=source_api`). Both are now physically removed; `_trace_forward_pcode`'s `source_api_name` parameter is now required (no default). No runtime behaviour change — the real Strategy 1 loop has resolved callees by name since v2.4.1. New guard-rail tests in `tests/test_ghidra_dead_code_removed.py` pin the removal.

## [2.7.1] — 2026-04-22

### Added

- **Phase 2C+.4 vendor extraction chain expansion** — pair-eval corpus grows 7 → 12 with five new vendor/model pairs covering D-Link DIR-859, D-Link DIR-878, ASUS RT-AC68U, Linksys WRT1900AC v2, and Linksys EA6700 (`benchmarks/pair-eval/pairs.json`). Combined with the existing 7-pair baseline, the manifest now satisfies Phase 2D' Entry Gate 5 (corpus ≥ 10) by registration alone. Measurement under `--no-llm` full pipeline at `benchmark-results/pair-eval-12pair-mixed/` shifts the scorecard from v2.7.0's **1/5 PASS** to **2/5 PASS** (Gate 4 Rerun + Gate 5 Corpus). Gates 1 (recall 0.143 → **0.167**, +17% relative), 2 (tier variation, unchanged at 1 nonzero TP tier), and 3 (diversity 1.000 → **0.917**) still FAIL. The new TP/FP pair (DIR-859 vuln + patched both hit `aiedge.findings.web.exec_sink_overlap`) corroborates the v2.7.0 diagnosis that `findings.py`'s single-synthesis-finding selection bottleneck remains the structural limit on Gate 1/3. An intermediate measurement under partial WRT1900AC extractions (1200s budget) showed Gate 2 transiently PASS due to `aiedge.findings.analysis_incomplete` populating the `unknown` tier; the figure of record is the ok-state measurement after the 2400-second budget rerun.

### Fixed

- **`scripts/score_pair_corpus.py` raised StopIteration on missing pair runs** — when a 12-pair manifest was scored against a 7-pair `run_index.json` the `next(...)` lookup for `vulnerable`/`patched` rows aborted the run. The scorer now records pairs with absent runs as `vulnerable_status="missing"` / `patched_status="missing"` and excludes them from recall/FPR denominators (graceful skip), so corpus growth and partial-coverage measurements no longer crash the release gate.

## [2.7.0] — 2026-04-20

Phase 2C+ close-out release. Pivot 2026-04-19 roadmap's detection-strengthening insert (LATTE backward slicing, LARA pattern-based source identification, sink coverage expansion, finding diversity gate) is merged, with a follow-up wire-through fix for the LARA `ascii_strings` path that was silently inert on the initial landing. The compliance-led track (Phase 3'.1 steps B-1..B-4) lands its four standard mappings (CRA Annex I / FDA Section 524B / ISO/SAE 21434 / UN R155) plus the `compliance_report` pipeline stage. The reviewer-evaluation lane is formally re-measured under these changes at `benchmark-results/pair-eval-dedicated-local7-codex-6h-r2-latte-on/` (Codex driver, 14/14 success, 12h 45min wall-clock), and the official numbers are recorded in `docs/v2.7.0_release_plan.md` for release-note reference.

The Phase 2D' entry gates (pair recall ≥ 0.40, tier variation ≥ 2, finding diversity < 0.5, dedicated rerun ≥ 1/N, pair corpus ≥ 10) were evaluated against the 14/14 measurement. Four of the five gates remain FAIL because `findings.py`'s primary-finding selection emits all vulnerability evidence through a single synthesis finding id (`aiedge.findings.web.exec_sink_overlap`), so 2C+ detection work enriches evidence but does not diversify finding ids at the gate's measurement plane. Gate 4 (dedicated rerun operational stability) passes 14/14 and is recorded as the substantive forward motion of this release. Per the pivot document's scenario C, the roadmap adopts option D: Phase 2D' is deferred as an external-track concern and SCOUT pivots fully to the compliance-led identity (`wiki/projects/scout-cra-audit-saas-scope.md` tracks the 3'.2 follow-on). 2C+.4 (vendor extraction chain expansion → corpus 7→10+) and 3'.1 step B-5 remain on deck for v2.7.1.

### Added

- **`compliance_report` stage (Phase 3'.1 step B-4)** (`src/aiedge/compliance_report.py`, `src/aiedge/stage_registry.py`, `src/aiedge/stage_dag.py`, `tests/test_compliance_report.py`). New 43rd pipeline stage that emits four per-standard markdown reports (`<run_dir>/stages/compliance_report/{cra_annex_i,fda_524b,iso_21434,un_r155}_report.md`) plus a structured `stage.json` evidence summary. Each report aggregates per-run counts from sbom / cve_scan / findings / cert_analysis / init_analysis / fs_permissions and links back to the canonical mapping document. Stage degrades to `partial` (without crashing) when no upstream artefacts are present, ensuring it always emits the four reports. Registered as `"compliance_report"` in `_STAGE_FACTORIES`; `STAGE_DEPS` records dependencies on `exploit_policy`, `sbom`, and `cve_scan` so it always runs after the other evidence-producing stages. _(8 new tests in `tests/test_compliance_report.py`.)_
- **LATTE-inspired text-based backward slicing (Phase 2C+.1)** (`src/aiedge/code_slicing.py`, `src/aiedge/taint_propagation.py`, `tests/test_code_slicing.py`, `docs/code_slicing_contract.md`). First-cut implementation of the LATTE (Liu et al., TOSEM 2025) prompt-slicing idea: when `AIEDGE_LATTE_SLICING=1` is set, `_build_taint_prompt()` replaces the full function body with a sink-rooted backward slice. The slice walks bottom-up from the sink call, keeping earlier lines whose identifiers overlap the tracked variables-of-interest (minus a conservative noise set of C keywords / literals / common macros). The slice is a strict subset of the original body with source order preserved; the sink line and the defining lines of its arguments are always retained. Public API: `find_sink_line`, `extract_backward_slice`, `extract_slice_around_sink`, `maybe_slice`, `slice_compression_ratio`, `latte_slicing_enabled`. Default-off keeps existing LLM prompts byte-identical. _(32 new tests in `tests/test_code_slicing.py`.)_
- **LARA-style URI / CGI / config-key source identification (Phase 2C+.2)** (`enhanced_source.py`, `tests/test_uri_source_extraction.py`). `EnhancedSourceStage` now widens source identification beyond C-level input APIs by recognising attacker-influenced strings, taking inspiration from the LARA paper (USENIX Sec 2024). Three new pattern sets totalling 50 entries cover URI prefixes (`/cgi-bin/`, `/api/`, `/upnp/`, `/admin/`, `/goform/`, ...), CGI environment variables (`QUERY_STRING`, `REQUEST_METHOD`, `HTTP_*`, ...), and NVRAM / sysconf config keys (`http_passwd`, `wpa_psk`, `cloud_token`, `firmware_url`, ...). New helper `_extract_uri_key_sources(bin_path, symbols, ascii_strings=None)` produces `(pattern, kind)` tuples that are wrapped per-binary into source dicts with `confidence=0.40` (SYMBOL_COOCCURRENCE cap, since string presence alone does not prove reachability) and `method="lara_pattern"`. Symbol-based URI matching is intentionally skipped to avoid noise; the optional `ascii_strings` parameter is the path for string-literal evidence (to be wired through inventory data in a follow-up). _(13 new tests in `tests/test_uri_source_extraction.py`.)_
- **Sink coverage expansion (Phase 2C+.3)** (`taint_propagation.py`, `tests/test_taint_propagation.py`). `_SINK_SYMBOLS` grows from 29 to 51 symbols, mapping the full CWE taxonomy that the firmware corpus actually exercises: CWE-78 cmd injection (now incl. `wordexp`, `posix_spawn`, `posix_spawnp`), CWE-22 path traversal (`fopen`, `open`, `openat`, `freopen`, `chdir`), CWE-426 search path (`dlsym`, `dlmopen`), CWE-732 perms (`chmod`/`fchmod`/`chown`/`fchown`/`lchown`), CWE-377 insecure tmp (`mktemp`, `tmpnam`, `tempnam`, `tmpfile`), CWE-250/269 privilege (`chroot`, `setuid`, `seteuid`, `setgid`, `setegid`), and CWE-454 env injection (`putenv`, `setenv`, `unsetenv`). `_FORMAT_STRING_SINKS` doubles from 6 to 15 with size-bounded (`vsnprintf`), file-descriptor (`dprintf`/`vdprintf`), and wide-char (`swprintf`, `vswprintf`, `wprintf`, `vwprintf`, `fwprintf`, `vfwprintf`) variants. `_is_format_string_variable()` is strengthened to flag struct field access, array subscripts, function-call results, C-style casts, parenthesised ternaries, and pointer dereferences as variable first-arguments — not just bare identifiers. _(20 new tests in `tests/test_taint_propagation.py`.)_
- **Finding diversity gate (Phase 2C+.5)** (`quality_policy.py`, `release_gate.sh`, `tests/test_finding_diversity_gate.py`, `docs/finding_diversity_gate.md`). Detects degenerate pair-eval coverage where every pair-side row maps to the same `finding_id` — the structural failure surfaced by the 2026-04-19 reviewer eval lane analysis (local-7 baseline `finding_diversity_index = 1.0`, all 14 rows on `aiedge.findings.web.exec_sink_overlap`). New helpers `compute_pair_eval_diversity_index()`, `load_pair_eval_finding_ids()`, `evaluate_pair_eval_diversity_gate()` produce a `QUALITY_GATE_DIVERSITY_MISS` violation when `max_share(finding_id) >= AIEDGE_PAIR_DIVERSITY_MAX` (default 0.5). `release_gate.sh` wires this in as the opt-in `PAIR_EVAL_DIVERSITY` sub-gate via `--pair-eval-findings`. _(12 new tests in `tests/test_finding_diversity_gate.py`.)_
- **Pair-eval timeout diagnostic** (`scripts/run_pair_eval.py`). When a pair-side run hits the wall-clock timeout, `_dump_timeout_diagnostic()` writes `<side>/timeout_diagnostic.json` capturing the last 200 stderr / 50 stdout lines, a best-effort run_dir guess, and the most recent stage's name/status. Closes the visibility gap that left the dedicated reviewer rerun lanes (`pair-eval-dedicated-local7-claude-6h`, `codex-6h`) stuck at `run_index rows = 0` without actionable signal.
- **FDA Section 524B compatibility mapping (Phase 3'.1 step B-2)** (`docs/compliance_mapping/fda_section_524b.md`). Maps SCOUT outputs to the four §524B(b) statutory obligations (postmarket vulnerability monitoring plan, secure design/develop/maintain processes, postmarket updates/patches, SBOM) and to the September 2023 FDA premarket cybersecurity guidance content elements (security objectives, threat modelling, security risk management, cybersecurity testing, architecture views, SBOM, vulnerability management, labelling, postmarket plan). Coverage is documented per element with explicit "out of scope" callouts for sponsor-side QMS deliverables. Disclaimer reuses the directory-wide "compatible with" wording rule.
- **ISO/SAE 21434 compatibility mapping (Phase 3'.1 step B-3)** (`docs/compliance_mapping/iso_21434.md`). Maps SCOUT outputs to ISO/SAE 21434:2021 work products across clauses 8 (continual cybersecurity activities), 9 (concept), 10 (product development), 11 (cybersecurity validation), 13 (operations and maintenance), and 15 (TARA methods). Identifies which work products are tool-friendly (WP-08-01..04, WP-10-04, WP-10-05, WP-13-02) versus manufacturer-side narratives (WP-09-02, WP-10-01, WP-10-02, etc.).
- **UN R155 compatibility mapping (Phase 3'.1 step B-3)** (`docs/compliance_mapping/un_r155.md`). Maps SCOUT outputs to UN R155 §7.2 (CSMS) and §7.3 (vehicle-type approval) requirements, plus per-threat guidance for the 15 most-relevant Annex 5 threat categories (manipulation, replay, malware insertion, network-design vulnerabilities, etc.). Co-published with the ISO/SAE 21434 mapping per the standard / regulation pairing.

### Changed

- **CRA mapping relocated into `docs/compliance_mapping/`** (`docs/compliance_mapping/cra_annex_i.md`, was `docs/cra_compliance_mapping.md`). Phase 3'.1 step B-1 sets up a four-document compliance-mapping suite (CRA Annex I / FDA Section 524B / ISO 21434 / UN R155); the CRA file ships first as the canonical baseline format, with sibling placeholders cross-linked from its header. References updated in README.md, README.ko.md, docs/status.md, CHANGELOG.md, and scripts/check_doc_consistency.py. The disclaimer is tightened to spell out that the "compatible with" wording is mandatory throughout the directory — any "compliant with" / "compliance" / "ready" substitution is rejected by `check_doc_consistency.py`.

### Fixed

- **LARA `ascii_strings` wire-through (Phase 2C+.2 follow-up)** (`src/aiedge/enhanced_source.py`). The initial 2C+.2 landing exposed the optional `ascii_strings` parameter on `_extract_uri_key_sources()` but the caller at `EnhancedSourceStage` never supplied it, so the URI-endpoint (`/cgi-bin/`, `/goform/`, `/soap/`, ...) and CGI-variable (`QUERY_STRING`, `HTTP_*`, ...) axes of the LARA pattern set degenerated to the empty set on every real firmware — `sources.json` carried zero `lara_pattern` entries across all 12 completed `pair-eval-dedicated-local7` Codex baseline runs despite the code path being resident. The fix reads the binary head (bounded to 2 MiB, up from the helper's previous 256 KiB default) via the existing `sbom._extract_ascii_runs` helper and passes the extracted printable tokens as `ascii_strings`, guarded with `path_safety.assert_under_dir()` and fail-open on I/O error. Validated on real D-Link httpd binaries sampled from the completed Codex baseline: BEFORE fix = 0 matches; AFTER fix = 10 matches on DIR-825 B1 (`/soap/` URI endpoint + 9 config_keys including `admin_passwd`, `wpa_psk`, `ssid`, `firmware_url`) and 33 on DIR-850L. The previously dead 2C+.2 axis now contributes attacker-influenced sources to the downstream taint layer.
- **AFL++ Docker fuzzing artifact ownership** (`fuzz_campaign.py`, PR #7). The Docker container is now invoked with the host user's uid/gid (`--user $(id -u):$(id -g)`), so files written under `stages/fuzzing/*/afl_output/` remain readable by SCOUT after the container exits. Previously, `_collect_stats` would raise `PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: .../fuzzer_stats` on any run that entered the fuzzing stage because the directory was created as `drwx------ root:root`. Validated on the OpenWrt Archer C7 v5 run (`2026-04-13_1014_sha256-bf9eeb5af38a`), where the pre-existing `PermissionError` no longer reproduces and `afl_output/default/` is now owned by the invoking user.
- **Fuzzing stage status when AFL++ never executes the target** (`fuzz_campaign.py`, PR #8). Campaigns that abort before any target execution — for example on forkserver handshake failure, QEMU architecture mismatch, or non-zero Docker exit — are no longer reported as `ok`. New helpers `_append_campaign_execution_limitations()` and `_campaign_completed()` record explicit limitations (`docker_exit_N`, `forkserver_handshake_failed`, `target_arch_mismatch`, `no_fuzzer_executions`) and refuse to increment `targets_completed` unless `stats.execs_done > 0`, so the stage correctly resolves to `partial` with actionable signal. Validated on the OpenWrt Archer C7 v5 MIPS-32 dnsmasq target, where AFL++ aborted with `Fork server handshake failed` and the stage now emits `status=partial` with all three limitations plus `targets_completed=0 / targets_attempted=1`. _(4 new tests in `tests/test_fuzz_campaign.py`.)_

## [2.6.1] — 2026-04-17

Phase 2C close-out release. This point release rolls up the post-v2.6.0 foundation hardening work, publishes the fresh corpus refresh baseline, and documents the semantic / driver caveats that were previously implicit.

### Added

- **Fresh corpus refresh baseline** (`docs/carry_over_benchmark_v2.6.md`, `benchmark-results/2c6-fresh-full-final/aggregate.json`, `scripts/aggregate_corpus_metrics.py`). The 1,123-target refresh is now published as a best-view aggregate across the fresh rerun waves. Final outcome: **1110 success / 4 partial / 9 fatal**; successful runs are `extraction=ok 1110/1110`, `inventory=sufficient 1110/1110`, `nonzero findings 1110/1110`, `nonzero CVE 1089/1110`.
- **LLM driver degradation matrix** (`docs/llm_driver_degradation_matrix.md`). Documents the actual contract differences between Codex CLI, Claude API, Claude Code CLI, and Ollama, especially around system-prompt delivery and temperature handling.
- **Confidence semantic break note** (`docs/confidence_semantic_break_v2.6.md`). Makes the v2.5.x → v2.6+ shift explicit: `confidence` is now evidence-only; `priority_score` / `priority_inputs` carry ranking semantics.

### Changed

- **README / README.ko baseline messaging**. Tier 1 hero numbers now point at the fresh v2.6.1 corpus refresh, while Tier 2 remains explicitly carry-over until the pair-eval lane lands. The over-broad "False negative rate ≈ 0%" phrasing is replaced with a pending pair-eval note.
- **Analyst copilot wording**. Public docs now split the surface into `Explainability surface`, `Analyst-in-the-loop channel`, and `Autonomous reasoning (future)` instead of presenting all LLM-related behavior as one undifferentiated capability.
- **Release governance helper** (`scripts/release.sh`). The helper is upgraded from a README-only version bumper into a release close-out utility that can synchronize pyproject, README badges, and CHANGELOG headers in dry-run/apply modes.

### Fixed

- **Synthesis finding reasoning trail inheritance** (`findings.py`). Top-level synthesis findings such as `aiedge.findings.web.exec_sink_overlap` now inherit matched downstream evidence lineage instead of relying only on the stage-level aggregate summary. Matching prefers run-relative binary path, falls back to binary SHA-256, emits a `findings/synthesis_match` summary entry, and appends a deterministic top-K sample of representative downstream trail entries.
- **SBOM stage silent schema mismatch** (`sbom.py`). Vendor-stock firmware no longer silently returns 0 components because of stale `inventory.file_list` / `string_hits` assumptions. The stage now walks `inventory.roots` directly and falls back to direct binary reads via `_extract_ascii_runs`.
- **Relative `runs_root` handling in `create_run()`** (`run.py`). `runs_root` is resolved before path derivation so relative output roots still wire absolute firmware paths into extraction; regression coverage lives in `tests/test_create_run_relative_runs_root.py`.

## [2.6.0] — 2026-04-13

Phase 2B release. Performance + analyst copilot UX + confidence calibration. 6 atomic commits, single-session parallel execution via worktree isolation. Merged via [PR #6](https://github.com/R00T-Kim/SCOUT/pull/6) (rebase). All downstream consumers untouched (PR #7a additive-first pattern maintained throughout).

### Added

- **`reasoning_trail.py`** — Structured reasoning trail capture for LLM-driven finding adjustments. `ReasoningEntry` dataclass with 200-char `raw_response_excerpt` cap enforced at construction (`__post_init__`). Helpers: `append_entry`, `redact_excerpt`, `empty_trail`, `format_trail_for_markdown`, `format_trail_for_tui`, `normalize_trail`. _(PR #11, PR #13)_
- **`scoring.py`** — Detection vs priority separation. `PriorityInputs` frozen dataclass (detection_confidence, epss_score, epss_percentile, reachability, backport_present, cvss_base) + `compute_priority_score()` (weights: detection 50% / EPSS 25% / reach 15% / CVSS 10%, backport -0.20 penalty) + `priority_bucket()` (critical/high/medium/low) + `priority_inputs_to_dict()`. Addresses external reviewer critique that EPSS-additive confidence looked like a ranking heuristic. _(PR #15)_
- **`stage_dag.py`** — Manual `STAGE_DEPS` dict (42 entries, exact `_STAGE_FACTORIES` match) + Kahn `topo_levels()` with deterministic alphabetic sort within levels + `validate_deps()` warning surface. `findings` excluded (integrated step), `exploit_gate` included (inline factory). 15 levels / max-width 7. _(PR #10)_
- **`run_stages_parallel()`** in `stage.py` — ThreadPoolExecutor level-wise execution with skip-on-failed-dep semantics, `fail_fast=True/False` modes, post-pool cancellation sweep. Sequential `run_stages()` unchanged. _(PR #10)_
- **`--experimental-parallel [N]`** CLI flag on both `analyze` and `stages` subparsers (default 4 workers when specified without value). _(PR #10)_
- **4 MCP analyst tools** in `mcp_server.py`: `scout_get_finding_reasoning`, `scout_inject_hint`, `scout_override_verdict`, `scout_filter_by_category`. Verdict enum validation, category validation via `FindingCategory` enum, `AIEDGE_MCP_MAX_OUTPUT_KB` truncation respected. _(PR #12)_
- **Feedback registry extension** in `terminator_feedback.py`: `add_analyst_hint`, `get_analyst_hints`, `set_verdict_override` with `fcntl.flock` write safety + `assert_under_dir` path enforcement. Backward-compatible schema (existing `verdicts` list preserved). _(PR #12)_
- **Analyst hint injection loop** in `adversarial_triage.py`: `_build_analyst_hint_prefix()` reads hints from `AIEDGE_FEEDBACK_DIR` and prefixes advocate prompts (priority-sorted). Opt-in via env var; byte-identical behavior when unset. _(PR #12)_
- **Extraction failure analyst guidance** in `extraction.py`: structured `extraction_guidance` injected into all 4 failure paths (firmware missing, invalid rootfs, no binwalk, timeout) + success path sweep. Surfaces vendor_decrypt hint, `--rootfs` option, binwalk variants, issue-filing template. `run.py._emit_extraction_guidance()` prints to stderr (quiet mode respected) and logs to run dir. _(PR #14)_
- **`docs/runbook.md#extraction-failure`** section with symptoms/causes/remediation table. _(PR #14)_
- **`docs/scoring_calibration.md`** — full two-score contract with before/after worked example. _(PR #15)_
- **`quality_metrics.py` per-priority bucket aggregation** (`count_findings_by_priority`, `PRIORITY_BUCKET_LABELS`) alongside existing per-confidence helpers. _(PR #15)_
- **Progress out-of-order mode** — `ProgressTracker(out_of_order=True)` uses internal `_completion_counter` independent of idx, for parallel stage completion. _(PR #10)_
- **Web viewer reasoning trail panel** — collapsible `<details>` section in the embedded template (`reporting.py`), CSS class set (`.reasoning-trail`, `.reasoning-trail-list`, `.reasoning-trail-rationale`), plain `Date()` for timestamp formatting. _(PR #13)_
- **Analyst markdown reasoning trail subsection** — numbered list in `report_assembler.py` `write_analyst_report_v2_md`. _(PR #13)_
- **TUI reasoning trail rendering** — `render_finding_detail_with_trail()` in `cli_tui_render.py`, `AIEDGE_TUI_ASCII`-compatible. _(PR #13)_

### Changed

- **`adversarial_triage.py`** debate loop now records structured reasoning trail entries for advocate / critic / decision steps with `llm_model` and truncated `raw_response_excerpt`. Existing `triage_outcome` field preserved unchanged. _(PR #11)_
- **`fp_verification.py`** records trail entries for `sanitizer_detected`, `non_propagating_detected`, `sysfile_detected`, and LLM `<pattern>_detected` / `llm_verdict` outcomes with per-pattern `delta`. Existing `fp_verdict` / `fp_rationale` fields preserved. _(PR #11)_
- **`findings.py`** additive `reasoning_trail` pass-through normalisation + `reasoning_trail_count` summary field (PR #11). Additive `priority_score` + `priority_inputs` + `priority_bucket_counts` annotation: CVE findings keep pre-computed score from `cve_scan.py`; all other findings get a default computed from `confidence` as the only known signal. **No schema version bump.** _(PR #11, PR #15)_
- **`cve_scan.py:1140-1170`** refactored: `confidence` field now strictly capped at `STATIC_CODE_VERIFIED_CAP=0.55` (static evidence only). EPSS / reachability / backport / CVSS now feed `priority_score` instead. Deleted orphan internals: `_REACHABILITY_MULTIPLIERS`, `_EPSS_BOOST_*`, `_EPSS_PENALTY_LOW`, `_epss_confidence_adjustment()`. _(PR #15)_
- **`sarif_export.py`** properties bag gains `scout_reasoning_trail` (PR #11) and `scout_priority_score` + `scout_priority_inputs` (PR #15) — mirrors the PR #7a `scout_category` precedent. _(PR #11, PR #15)_
- **`run.py`** `run_subset()` + `analyze_run()` now accept both `quiet: bool` (PR #14) and `experimental_parallel: int | None` (PR #10) kwargs; call sites in `__main__.py` plumb both through. Autopoc rerun (line ~4097) remains sequential (single-stage reinvocation). _(PR #10, PR #14)_
- **`reporting.py`** analyst report markdown path now consumes `reasoning_trail` via `report_assembler.py` helpers and includes a numbered "Reasoning Trail (N steps)" subsection per finding. Viewer template gains JS render block reading `item.reasoning_trail`. _(PR #13)_
- **`cli_tui_data.py`** surfaces `findings_with_trails` in snapshot dict via new `_collect_tui_findings_with_trails` helper. _(PR #13)_
- **`cli_tui_render.py`** snapshot includes `_append_findings_with_trails_section` block that runs even when no exploit candidates exist. _(PR #13)_

### Verified

- **pytest**: 865 → **1027 passed, 1 skipped** (+162 new tests: 20 reasoning_trail unit + 18 extraction_guidance + 33 mcp_analyst_tools + 14 stage_dag + 14 run_stages_parallel + 19 scoring + 44 reasoning_trail_viewer)
- **ruff**: all checks passed
- **pyright**: 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 informations (Phase 2A baseline preserved)
- **CI 5/5 green**: lint / typecheck / test (3.10) / test (3.11) / test (3.12)
- **R7000 smoke (PR #15, codex driver)**: 3 findings, all carry `priority_score` + `priority_inputs`; `cve_confidence_above_0.55_cap = 0` (detection cap correctly enforced); `priority_bucket_counts = {critical: 0, high: 0, medium: 3, low: 0}`; `category_counts = {vulnerability: 1, pipeline_artifact: 2, misconfiguration: 0, unclassified: 0}`

### Design Invariants Preserved

- Additive only on `findings.py` (PR #7a pattern for `category`, now also `reasoning_trail`, `priority_score`, `priority_inputs`). **No report schema version bump.** Existing 7 downstream consumers untouched.
- Sequential `run_stages()` behavior bit-identical to pre-PR state.
- `StageContext` frozen invariant preserved (thread-safe sharing without locks).
- All file writes continue to route through `assert_under_dir()` (`path_safety.py`).
- Existing LLM driver contracts untouched; system_prompt + temperature + 5-stage parser (v2.5.0) all continue to work.
- 200-char `raw_response_excerpt` cap enforced at construction time in `ReasoningEntry.__post_init__` (cannot be bypassed by call sites).

## [2.5.0] — 2026-04-14

### Added
- **`llm_prompts.py`** — Centralized system prompt module: `STRUCTURED_JSON_SYSTEM`, `ADVOCATE_SYSTEM`, `CRITIC_SYSTEM`, `TAINT_SYSTEM`, `CLASSIFIER_SYSTEM`, `REPAIR_SYSTEM`, `SYNTHESIS_SYSTEM` + temperature constants
- **LLMDriver Protocol**: `system_prompt: str = ""` and `temperature: float | None = None` parameters wired into all 4 drivers (CodexCLI, ClaudeAPI, ClaudeCodeCLI, Ollama)
- **EPSS scoring** in `cve_scan.py`: FIRST.org API integration with batched queries, per-run + cross-run cache, confidence adjustment based on EPSS percentile
- **Sink expansion** (`taint_propagation.py`): `_SINK_SYMBOLS` 11 → 28 entries (memcpy, memmove, strcat, strncpy, gets, vsprintf, printf, fprintf, syslog, vprintf, vfprintf, snprintf, scanf, sscanf, fscanf, dlopen, realpath)
- **Format string sink set**: `_FORMAT_STRING_SINKS` + `_is_format_string_variable()` helper for variable-controlled format string detection
- **GitHub Action**: `.github/actions/scout-scan/` composite action for CI/CD with SARIF upload to GitHub Security tab
- **CRA compatibility documentation**: `docs/compliance_mapping/cra_annex_i.md` mapping all 12 EU Cyber Resilience Act Annex I requirements to SCOUT outputs (output formats compatible with CRA Annex I)
- **Strategic roadmap**: `docs/strategic_roadmap_2026.md` 3-Phase plan based on 30+ academic papers and competitive analysis (Theori Xint, FirmAgent, EU CRA)
- LLM failure observability: `parse_failures` vs `llm_call_failures` separation in `adversarial_triage.py` and `fp_verification.py`
- Common LLM failure classification helpers in `llm_driver.py` (`quota_exhausted`, `driver_unavailable`, `driver_nonzero_exit`)

### Fixed
- **`parse_json_from_llm_output()`** rewritten as 5-stage parser: preamble strip → fence extract → raw text → brace-counting object extraction → common error fix (trailing commas, single quotes). Optional `required_keys` schema validation
- **CVE scan signature-only path**: removed early `return` so signature-only matches go through the same enrichment/finding-candidate pipeline as NVD matches
- **CVE scan `comp` variable bug**: backport confidence adjustment now uses per-match component metadata instead of leaked outer loop variable (was incorrectly applying last component's metadata to all matches)
- **Semantic classifier batch size**: reduced from 50 → 15 functions per LLM call to prevent JSON schema loss in long contexts

### Changed
- All LLM-using stages now pass appropriate `system_prompt` and `temperature` (deterministic 0.0 for JSON tasks, analytical 0.3 for advocate/critic debate)
- `adversarial_triage.py`: advocate/critic prompts cleaned (persona moved to system prompt), few-shot examples added
- `fp_verification.py`: unverified outcomes now distinguish parse failures from driver call failures
- `taint_propagation.py`: `_NETWORK_INPUT_SYMBOLS` expanded with `read`, `fread`

### Verified
- **R7000 (Netgear, 31MB) end-to-end run** (codex driver, 2026-04-13):
  - `adversarial_triage`: debated=100, parsed_ok=100, **parse_failures=0**, llm_call_failures=0, downgraded=99, maintained=1
  - `fp_verification`: eligible=100, true_positives=57, false_positives=43, **unverified=0**, parse_failures=0, llm_call_failures=0
  - `cve_scan`: matches=23, **epss_enriched=23/23**
  - Run: `aiedge-runs/2026-04-12_1320_sha256-b28bf08e9d2c`
- Pre-v2.5 baseline (same firmware, 2026-04-12 1211 run): adversarial parse_failures=100/100, fp unverified=97/100, EPSS 0/23

## [2.4.1] — 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- `decompiled_colocated` confidence reduced 0.60→0.45 (0.50 for high-risk sinks) — Terminator feedback: evidence level same as symbol co-occurrence
- P-code taint `addr_diff > 16` replaced with callee name matching via `resolve_call_target()` — robust against compiler optimizations

### Added
- **Interprocedural taint** (Strategy 4): cross-function source→sink detection via xref call graph
  - `decompiled_interprocedural` method: caller has source + calls callee with sink → conf 0.55-0.60
  - 1-hop depth limit to control false positives
  - Verified: `fread→vsprintf` across `FUN_00012514→FUN_00011fe0` in RT-AX88U

### Changed
- `taint_propagation.py`: separate confidence caps per method (pcode_colocated 0.65, decompiled_colocated 0.50, decompiled_interprocedural 0.60)

## [2.4.0] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Ghidra P-code taint analysis** (`ghidra_scripts/pcode_taint.py`): 3-strategy dataflow tracing (P-code SSA → P-code colocated → decompiled body), replacing symbol co-occurrence
- `PCODE_VERIFIED_CAP = 0.75` — 4-tier confidence caps: SYMBOL_COOCCURRENCE (0.40) < STATIC_CODE_VERIFIED (0.55) < STATIC_ONLY (0.60) < PCODE_VERIFIED (0.75)
- 4 new source pattern rule families: `sql_injection`, `format_string`, `path_traversal`, `ssrf` (9 regex patterns across PHP/Python/C/shell)
- CGI handler detection in `surfaces.py`: extracts `do_*_cgi` function names from Ghidra string_refs as source endpoints
- `INPUT_APIS` expanded: `cJSON_Parse`, `json_tokener_parse`, `xmlParseMemory`
- SBOM backport detection: `_Component.patch_revision` field, opkg version revision parsing
- CVE scan backport filter: -0.30 confidence for opkg packages with patch revision
- `adversarial_triage` schema reference in `firmware_handoff.json` for downstream consumers (Terminator)
- pyghidra fallback now generates `pcode_taint.json` with decompiled body analysis

### Changed
- `taint_propagation.py`: P-code verified results prioritized over static inference; P-code-covered binaries skipped in static fallback
- `ghidra_bridge.py`: `pcode_taint.py` added to default script set
- Detection engine confidence: symbol co-occurrence findings now differentiated from function-level verified findings

### Verified
- ASUS RT-AX88U: 5 new `decompiled_colocated` traces (nvram_get→vsprintf conf 0.60, sanitizer detection working)
- Before/after: 10 static_inference → 10 static + 5 Ghidra-verified, confidence 0.40→0.60 (+50%)

## [2.3.0] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- Adversarial triage parallelization via ThreadPoolExecutor (`AIEDGE_ADV_PARALLEL`, default 8) — 6h→50min per firmware
