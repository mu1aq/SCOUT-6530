# SCOUT (v3.0.0-rc1)

### AEG-First Firmware Exploitability Platform with Deterministic Evidence Lineage

**SCOUT is an AEG-first firmware analysis platform that transforms raw firmware blobs into evidence-anchored exploitability chains, lab-bounded Proof-of-Vulnerability modules, and audit-ready dossiers. Now featuring a Hybrid Analysis Engine for both Binary and Shell Script auditing.**

*While traditional scanners prioritize bulk and speed, SCOUT acts as a high-fidelity AEG copilot: it reconstructs exploit chains across ELF binaries and shell scripts, explains its reasoning with evidence trails, and generates lab-bounded PoV/PoC modules rather than raw public-PoC copies.*

<h2 id="what-you-can-do">🚀 What you can do with SCOUT</h2>

- **Hybrid Triage**: Audit both ELF binaries and shell scripts in a single unified pipeline.
- **Deep Exploit Discovery**: Find complex `Web -> IPC -> Config -> Daemon` or `Shell -> Binary` chains.
- **AEG-first AutoPoC**: Leverage the **Exploit Pattern RAG** to generate lab-ready Proof-of-Vulnerability modules from firmware evidence.
  - SCOUT now includes a metadata-only PoC-in-GitHub importer and a human-review-required draft pattern-card promoter for firmware-relevant CVE seeds before AutoPoC retrieval.
  - SCOUT does **not** clone, execute, or prompt-inject raw public PoC repositories for copy-based exploitation. A platform-level AEG claim must pass the E2E dynamic/FP gate in [`docs/aeg_e2e_validation.md`](docs/aeg_e2e_validation.md). See also [`docs/exploit-pattern-rag.md`](docs/exploit-pattern-rag.md).
- **Evidence Investigation**: Use the Glassmorphism Web Dashboard to walk through decompiled P-code and shell logic.
- **Audit/compliance-compatible reporting**: Generate SARIF, CycloneDX 1.6 SBOM+VEX, and SLSA L2 attestations.

<h2 id="why-scout">💎 The SCOUT Advantage</h2>

> **[1] Hybrid Analysis Engine (v3)**
> Bridges the gap between binary-level execution and high-level shell logic, expanding coverage into script-driven firmware attack surfaces that binary-only pipelines miss.

> **[2] Hash-Anchored Evidence Lineage**
> Every finding is tied to a specific file path, byte offset, and SHA-256 hash. No black-box guesses.

> **[3] Intelligent Analyst Copilot**
> Built-in LLM tribunal (Advocate/Critic) reduces false positives by 99.3% on the historical Tier-2 benchmark using the registered multi-stage triage pipeline.

> **[4] Zero Dependency (Pure Stdlib)**
> No `pip install` nightmares. Deploy instantly in air-gapped labs or restricted environments.

<h2 id="quick-start">⚡ Quick Start</h2>

```bash
# Analyze a firmware image (Hybrid mode enabled by default)
./scout analyze firmware.bin

# Explore findings in the Web Dashboard
./scout serve aiedge-runs/<run_id> --port 8080

# Deep dive in the Terminal UI
./scout ti

# Seed Exploit Pattern RAG candidates from PoC-in-GitHub metadata only
python scripts/import_poc_in_github_candidates.py --dry-run

# Draft a human-review-required pattern card from one candidate
python scripts/draft_exploit_pattern_card.py data/exploit_references/candidates/poc_in_github/cve-2024-1781.json --print-json

# After a real authorized lab run, enforce dynamic proof + FP/FPR evidence
python scripts/aeg_e2e_gate.py aiedge-runs/<run_id>

# CI-safe AEG regression: vulnerable lab service must pass, patched control must fail closed
python scripts/run_aeg_synthetic_pair.py --work-root /tmp/scout-aeg-synthetic-pair

# Inspect which Exploit Pattern RAG cards have vulnerable/control evidence
