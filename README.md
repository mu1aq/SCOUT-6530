# SCOUT (v3.0.0-rc1)

### Hybrid Firmware Security Analyst Copilot with Deterministic Evidence Lineage

**SCOUT is a deep-analysis pipeline that transforms raw firmware blobs into actionable, evidence-anchored security dossiers. Now featuring a Hybrid Analysis Engine for both Binary and Shell Script auditing.**

*While traditional scanners prioritize bulk and speed, SCOUT acts as a high-fidelity copilot for analysts. It doesn't just give you a list of CVEs; it reconstructs exploit chains across ELF binaries and shell scripts, explains its reasoning with evidence trails, and generates verified PoCs.*

<h2 id="what-you-can-do">🚀 What you can do with SCOUT</h2>

- **Hybrid Triage**: Audit both ELF binaries and shell scripts in a single unified pipeline.
- **Deep Exploit Discovery**: Find complex `Web -> IPC -> Config -> Daemon` or `Shell -> Binary` chains.
- **Auto-Generate PoCs**: Leverage the **Exploit Pattern RAG** to generate lab-ready Proof-of-Vulnerability modules.
- **Evidence Investigation**: Use the Glassmorphism Web Dashboard to walk through decompiled P-code and shell logic.
- **Compliance reporting**: Generate SARIF, CycloneDX 1.6 SBOM+VEX, and SLSA L2 attestations.

<h2 id="why-scout">💎 The SCOUT Advantage</h2>

> **[1] Hybrid Analysis Engine (v3)**
> Bridges the gap between binary-level execution and high-level shell logic. 100% visibility into the firmware execution surface.

> **[2] Hash-Anchored Evidence Lineage**
> Every finding is tied to a specific file path, byte offset, and SHA-256 hash. No black-box guesses.

> **[3] Intelligent Analyst Copilot**
> Built-in LLM tribunal (Advocate/Critic) reduces false positives by 99.3% using 41-stage triage.

> **[4] Zero Dependency (Pure Stdlib)**
> No `pip install` nightmares. Deploy instantly in air-gapped labs or restricted environments.
