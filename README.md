# SCOUT

### Firmware Security Analysis Pipeline with Deterministic Evidence Packaging

**Drop a firmware blob. Get SARIF findings, CycloneDX SBOM+VEX, hash-anchored evidence, and analyst-ready reasoning trails -- in one command.**

*SCOUT is optimized for deep analysis of a single firmware image: it acts as an analyst copilot grounded in evidence lineage, not an autonomous verdict engine. Ghidra P-code taint, adversarial LLM adjudication, reasoning persistence across findings/reports/viewer/TUI, zero pip dependencies.*

> [!NOTE]
> **Tier 1 numbers in this README now reflect the fresh v2.6.1 corpus refresh** (`docs/carry_over_benchmark_v2.6.md`): 1,123 targets, **1110 success / 4 partial / 9 fatal**. Tier 2 LLM numbers are still carry-over (`v2.3.0`, 36 firmware) until the pair-eval lane lands. See [`docs/benchmark_governance.md`](docs/benchmark_governance.md), [`docs/carry_over_benchmark_v2.6.md`](docs/carry_over_benchmark_v2.6.md), and [`benchmarks/baselines/v2.5.0/manifest.json`](benchmarks/baselines/v2.5.0/manifest.json).

> [!TIP]
> **What's new in v2.7.3** (Universal Chaining + ER605 Comexe DDNS quality pass)
> - **ER605/Comexe DDNS chain modeling.** `exploitability_dossier` now recognizes `cmxddnsd` candidates using Comexe server names, `Data`, `ErrorCode`, `UpdateSvr1/2`, and parser sink markers, then emits `dns_mitm`, `udp_ddns_response`, `parser_field`, and `info_leak_then_control` channels.
> - **Protocol-aware Plan IR and AutoPoC selection.** `exploit_state_machine` preserves dossier families and lowers Comexe candidates to `classify_ddns_protocol_chain_quality`; AutoPoC avoids duplicate candidate IDs across dossier/state-machine sources.
> - **Non-weaponized DDNS blueprint template.** `poc_templates.py` adds a Comexe DDNS quality template that records safe packet/Plan-IR hashes and quality checks without generating overlong fields, ROP, command payloads, DES key recovery, or spoofing infrastructure.
> - **PoC quality review documented.** See [`docs/er605_poc_quality.md`](docs/er605_poc_quality.md) for the quality assessment against the public ER605 analysis and the remaining live-lab verifier gaps.

> [!TIP]
> **What's new in v2.7.2** (Phase 2C++ detection-engine integrity patch — no scorecard movement expected)
> - **Phase 2C++.1 — `DECOMPILED_COLOCATED_CAP = 0.45` promoted to a named constant.** The `decompiled_colocated` taint method previously hardcoded a `0.50` ceiling inline. The 5-tier cap ladder (`SYMBOL_COOCCURRENCE 0.40 < DECOMPILED_COLOCATED 0.45 < STATIC_CODE_VERIFIED 0.55 < STATIC_ONLY 0.60 < PCODE_VERIFIED 0.75`) is now externally cited. Consumer impact: `decompiled_colocated` traces drop `0.50 → 0.45` (-0.05); ROC thresholds previously pinned at 0.50 should be retuned to 0.45. `priority_score` and `cve_scan`'s `STATIC_CODE_VERIFIED_CAP=0.55` unchanged. Rationale: the v2.4.0 external review (`docs/upgrade_plz.md` Gap C) flagged the prior value as over-confident relative to body-text-only evidence.
> - **Phase 2C++.2 — legacy `addr_diff > 16` residues removed from `ghidra_analysis.py` and `ghidra_scripts/pcode_taint.py`.** Commit `3352783` (v2.4.1) replaced the primary CALL-matching path with callee-name resolution but left a dead `trace_pcode_forward()` helper inside `_PYGHIDRA_SCRIPT` and an unreachable `else: addr_diff` fallback in the analyzeHeadless Strategy 1 loop. Both are now physically removed; `_trace_forward_pcode()`'s `source_api_name` parameter is required (no default). No runtime behaviour change — the production paths have done callee-name matching for 13 days already. Guard-rail tests in `tests/test_ghidra_dead_code_removed.py` pin the removal.
> - **No scorecard movement expected.** Gap B was runtime-effective since v2.4.1. Gap C's new ceiling only binds on `decompiled_colocated` traces, which are emitted solely by the pyghidra fallback (`ghidra_analysis.py:609`) that Ghidra-12 environments don't exercise. Phase 2D' Entry Gate remains at the v2.7.1 figure of record (**2/5 PASS**). Pair-eval re-measurement is deferred to the session that evaluates Gap A (interprocedural taint) ROI.
> - **Pivot Option D (compliance-led identity) remains in force.** v2.7.2 is detection-engine hygiene, not a behavioural pivot. The `compliance_report` stage and four standard mappings shipped in v2.7.0 are unchanged.

> [!TIP]
> **What's new in v2.7.1** (Phase 2C+.4 vendor corpus expansion — quantitative refinement of v2.7.0's scenario C)
> - **Pair-eval corpus extended 7 → 12 pairs** — five new vendor/model entries: D-Link DIR-859 (CVE-2019-17621), D-Link DIR-878 (vendor advisory), ASUS RT-AC68U (CVE-2020-15498), Linksys WRT1900AC v2 (progression), and Linksys EA6700 (progression). Manifest registration alone clears Phase 2D' Entry Gate 5 (corpus ≥ 10).
> - **Phase 2D' Entry Gate scorecard: 1/5 → 2/5 PASS** (Gate 4 Rerun + Gate 5 Corpus). Gate 1 recall improves 0.143 → 0.167 (+17% relative) but still FAIL; Gate 2 (tier variation) and Gate 3 (finding diversity 0.917) remain FAIL. The new TP/FP pair (DIR-859 vuln + patched both hit `aiedge.findings.web.exec_sink_overlap`) corroborates the v2.7.0 diagnosis that `findings.py`'s single-synthesis-finding selection is the structural Gate 1/3 limit.
> - **Honest measurement-of-record protocol** — an intermediate 1st-pass measurement under partial WRT1900AC extractions transiently showed Gate 2 PASS due to `aiedge.findings.analysis_incomplete` populating the `unknown` tier; the figure of record is the ok-state measurement after the 2400-second budget rerun (Gate 2 reverts to FAIL). Documented in `docs/v2.7.1_release_plan.md`.
> - **Scorer reliability fix** — `scripts/score_pair_corpus.py` now graceful-skips pairs with absent runs (`vulnerable_status="missing"` / `patched_status="missing"`) instead of aborting on `StopIteration`, so corpus growth and partial-coverage measurements no longer crash the release gate.
> - **Pivot Option D (compliance-led identity) remains in force** — v2.7.1 is a quantitative refinement of v2.7.0's scenario C, not a re-pivot. The `compliance_report` stage and four standard mappings shipped in v2.7.0 are unchanged.

## Why SCOUT?

> **Every finding has a hash-anchored evidence chain.**
> No finding without a file path, byte offset, SHA-256 hash, and rationale. Artifacts are immutable and traceable from firmware blob to final verdict.

> **4-tier confidence caps with Ghidra P-code verification -- honest scoring.**
> SYMBOL_COOCCURRENCE capped at 0.40, STATIC_CODE_VERIFIED at 0.55, STATIC_ONLY at 0.60, PCODE_VERIFIED at 0.75. Promotion to `confirmed` requires dynamic verification. We don't inflate scores.

> **SARIF + CycloneDX VEX + SLSA provenance -- standard formats.**
> GitHub Code Scanning, VS Code, CI/CD integration out of the box.

> **Built for analyst-in-the-loop firmware review.**
> SCOUT is strongest when used to start deep review on a single firmware image quickly, expose evidence paths, and preserve matched reasoning lineage across triage and reporting surfaces. Analyst hints loop back into next-run LLM adjudication via MCP, while final verdict ownership stays with the reviewer.

> **ER605-style exploitability dossiers.**
> The `exploitability_dossier` stage converts findings into an analysis-only decision log: target context, input surface, reachability, controllability, primitive hypothesis, mitigation friction, chain candidates, and patch/variant questions. It ranks exploit leads without generating payloads or claiming verified exploitability.
> In the gated `profile=exploit` lane, those ranked leads can seed `exploit_autopoc`, which generates lab-only proof plugins and verifies them through `exploit_runner`, `poc_validation`, and `exploit_policy`.

## Analyst Copilot Surfaces

### Explainability surface
- `reasoning_trail` and evidence lineage are preserved across findings, analyst Markdown, TUI, web viewer, and SARIF properties.
- This is where reviewers inspect *why* a finding was downgraded, upheld, or promoted.

### Analyst-in-the-loop channel
- MCP tools and `AIEDGE_FEEDBACK_DIR` are the supported override/hint path.
- Human hints are allowed to influence the next run; final ownership still stays with the analyst.

### Autonomous reasoning (future)
- SCOUT is **not** positioned as a fully autonomous exploit agent in v2.6.1.
- Multi-agent exploit chains, pair-grounded evaluation loops, and autonomous fuzz harness generation remain **Phase 2D / reviewer-eval lane** work.

## Pipeline (47 Stages)

## Benchmarks

### Tier 1 (Static, frozen baseline)

_Baseline: v2.6.1, 2026-04-17, fresh corpus refresh (`docs/carry_over_benchmark_v2.6.md`)_

- `1,123` firmware / `8` vendors / **98.8%** success rate
- `1,110` success / `4` partial / `9` fatal
- `3,531` findings / `146,943` CVE matches
- `1,089 / 1,110` successful runs produced nonzero CVE output

### Tier 2 (LLM-Adjudicated Adversarial Debate, GPT-5.3-Codex)

_Baseline: v2.3.0, 2026-04-09, claude-code driver (carry-over; pair-eval lane still pending)_

- `36` firmware / `9` vendors
- `2,430` findings debated → `2,412` downgraded + `18` maintained
- **LLM-adjudicated FPR reduction: 99.3%** | **pair-grounded FN/FP: pending reviewer eval lane**

### v2.6.0 Post-merge Real-Firmware Validation

_This section records post-release real-firmware validation runs, distinct from the carry-over corpus baselines above._

#### Validation target 1 — Netgear R7000 (codex driver, `--experimental-parallel 4`)

| Metric | v2.5.0 | v2.6.0 |
|---|---|---|
| `adversarial_triage` parse_failures | 0/100 | **0/100** (100 debated, 97 downgraded, 3 maintained) |
| `fp_verification` unverified | 0/100 | **0/100** (100 verified: 56 TP, 44 FP) |
| `reasoning_trail_count` (top-level findings) | N/A | **0/3** top-level / **100/100** at `adversarial_triage` + `fp_verification` artifacts ¹ |
| findings with `priority_score` | N/A | **3/3** (100% additive priority annotation) |
| `priority_bucket_counts` | N/A | `{critical: 0, high: 0, medium: 3, low: 0}` |
| category distribution | N/A | `{vulnerability: 1, pipeline_artifact: 2, misconfiguration: 0, unclassified: 0}` |
| `cve_scan` EPSS enriched | 23/23 | **0** (stage skipped — `sbom` landed partial and `cve_scan`/`reachability` skip on `sbom` dependency failure ²) |
| `--experimental-parallel 4` wall-clock | N/A | **~170 minutes** end-to-end across the registered pipeline (`fp_verification` dominant at 113 min; no sequential baseline for delta) |

¹ **v2.6.0 → v2.6.1 follow-up (commit `7b36274`)**: the top-level synthesis finding (`web.exec_sink_overlap`) now inherits matched downstream evidence lineage instead of relying only on the stage-level aggregate summary. Matching prefers run-relative binary path, falls back to binary SHA-256, and samples representative downstream trail entries deterministically so the synthesis finding reflects the alerts that actually informed it. This R7000 run reflects the v2.6.0 shipped behaviour.

² **v2.6.0 → v2.6.1 follow-up (commit `8e0bb82`)**: the R7000 extraction actually succeeded (1,664 files, 2,412 binaries scanned under `squashfs-root`), but the SBOM stage returned 0 components on this firmware due to a silent schema mismatch — `_collect_so_files_from_inventory` read `inventory.file_list` (a pre-v2.x key no longer emitted) and `_detect_from_binary_analysis` expected per-entry `string_hits` (replaced by `matched_symbols` in the current inventory schema). OpenWrt hid the bug because its opkg database alone contributes 100+ components. The fix makes both helpers walk `inventory.roots` directly and fall back to reading the binary file contents via a new `_extract_ascii_runs` helper. A clean re-run of just `SbomStage` on this R7000 run raises the component count from **0 to 4** (`curl 7.36.0` via binary read, plus `openssl 1.0.0` / `libz 1` / `libpthread 0` via `.so*` walking). Downstream `cve_scan` / `reachability` would then produce real CVE + EPSS numbers on a full pipeline re-run.

#### Validation target 2 — OpenWrt Archer C7 v5 (TP-Link, `--no-llm`)

| Metric | v2.6.0 |
|---|---|
| total findings | **3** |
| `reasoning_trail_count` | **0** _(no-llm: adversarial_triage and fp_verification are LLM-gated; trail is populated only when LLM stages run)_ |
| findings with `priority_score` | **3 / 3** _(100% — additive priority annotation succeeded for all findings)_ |
| `priority_bucket_counts` | `{critical: 0, high: 0, medium: 3, low: 0}` |
| category distribution | `{vulnerability: 1, pipeline_artifact: 2, misconfiguration: 0, unclassified: 0}` _(PR #7a 3-category ontology, 0% unclassified rate)_ |
| notable caveats | OpenWrt is `squashfs` ext4 root; binwalk extracted cleanly; `--no-llm` path skipped reasoning_trail generation as expected. Run completed end-to-end through `findings` stage. |

**Current benchmark contract**

- Archived benchmark bundles are now expected to be **run replicas**, not flattened JSON snapshots.
- Benchmark quality is reported in two layers:
  - **analysis rate** = pipeline completed (`success + partial`)
  - **analyst-ready rate** = archived bundle passes analyst/verifier checks and remains evidence-navigable
- `benchmark-results/legacy/tier2-llm-v2` is a **legacy snapshot**. It is useful for historical reference and re-evaluation, but it should not be used as the canonical analyst-readiness baseline.
- The current contract has been validated on a fresh single-sample run (`benchmark-results/tier2-single-fidelity`) where both analyst verifiers passed from the archived bundle.

**Current LLM quality behavior**

- `llm_triage` model routing: `<=10 haiku`, `11-50 sonnet`, `>50 or chain-backed opus`
- `llm_triage` retries with `sonnet` if a `haiku` call exits non-zero
- `llm_triage`, `semantic_classification`, `adversarial_triage`, and `fp_verification` now write `stages/<stage>/llm_trace/*.json`
- Parse failures are handled fail-closed: repaired when possible, otherwise reported as degraded/partial instead of silently treated as clean success
