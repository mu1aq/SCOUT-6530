# SCOUT

### Firmware Security Analyst Copilot with Deterministic Evidence Lineage

**SCOUT is a deep-analysis pipeline that transforms raw firmware blobs into actionable, evidence-anchored security dossiers.**

*While traditional scanners prioritize bulk and speed, SCOUT acts as a high-fidelity copilot for analysts. It doesn't just give you a list of CVEs; it reconstructs exploit chains, explains its reasoning with evidence trails, and generates verified PoCs using the new Exploit Pattern RAG engine.*

<h2 id="what-you-can-do">🚀 What you can do with SCOUT</h2>

- **Automated Triage**: Drop a blob and get a high-fidelity list of findings ranked by `confidence` and `priority_score`.
- **Deep Exploit Discovery**: Find complex `Web -> IPC -> Config -> Daemon` chains that bypass traditional static analysis.
- **Auto-Generate PoCs**: Leverage the **Exploit Pattern RAG** to generate lab-ready Proof-of-Vulnerability modules based on historical attack patterns.
- **Evidence Investigation**: Use the Glassmorphism Web Dashboard or the Interactive TUI to walk through decompiled P-code taint paths and reasoning trails.
- **Compliance reporting**: Generate SARIF findings for GitHub Security, CycloneDX 1.6 SBOM+VEX for FDA/CRA, and SLSA L2 attestations for provenance.

---

<h2 id="why-scout">💎 The SCOUT Advantage</h2>

> **[1] Hash-Anchored Evidence Lineage**
> Every finding is tied to a specific file path, byte offset, and SHA-256 hash. No black-box guesses — only traceable reasoning trails from blob to verdict.

> **[2] Intelligent Analyst Copilot**
> Built-in LLM tribunal (Advocate/Critic) reduces false positives by 99.3%. It doesn't replace you; it presents the evidence and reasoning for you to confirm.

> **[3] Zero Dependency (Pure Stdlib)**
> No `pip install` nightmares. SCOUT is pure Python 3.10+ stdlib. Deploy instantly in air-gapped labs or highly restricted environments.

> **[4] Channel-Aware Exploit RAG (v2.8.0)**
> SCOUT understands the *context* of a vulnerability. It matches candidates to structured exploit patterns to generate sophisticated, 다단계(stateful) PoC modules instead of flat socket scripts.

---

<h2 id="quick-start">⚡ Quick Start</h2>

```bash
# Analyze a firmware image
./scout analyze firmware.bin

# Explore findings in the Web Dashboard
./scout serve aiedge-runs/<run_id> --port 8080

# Deep dive in the Terminal UI
./scout ti
```

---

> [!TIP]
> **What's new in v2.8.0**
> - **Exploit Pattern RAG**: Metadata-backed reference retrieval for stateful PoC generation.
> - **Contamination Guard**: Automatically blocks reference-specific artifacts from leaking into generated PoCs.
> - **Channel Taxonomy Alignment**: Standardized cross-stage channel identification (Web, Config, IPC).

---
> No finding without a file path, byte offset, SHA-256 hash, and rationale. Artifacts are immutable and traceable from firmware blob to final verdict.

> **4-tier confidence caps with Ghidra P-code verification -- honest scoring.**
> SYMBOL_COOCCURRENCE capped at 0.40, STATIC_CODE_VERIFIED at 0.55, STATIC_ONLY at 0.60, PCODE_VERIFIED at 0.75. Promotion to `confirmed` requires dynamic verification. We don't inflate scores.

> **SARIF + CycloneDX VEX + SLSA provenance -- standard formats.**
> GitHub Code Scanning, VS Code, CI/CD integration out of the box.

> **Built for analyst-in-the-loop firmware review.**
> SCOUT is strongest when used to start deep review on a single firmware image quickly, expose evidence paths, and preserve matched reasoning lineage across triage and reporting surfaces. Analyst hints loop back into next-run LLM adjudication via MCP, while final verdict ownership stays with the reviewer.

> **Deep-chain exploitability dossiers.**
> The `exploitability_dossier` stage converts findings into an analysis-only decision log: target context, input surface, reachability, controllability, primitive hypothesis, mitigation friction, chain candidates, and patch/variant questions. It ranks exploit leads without generating payloads or claiming verified exploitability.
> In the gated `profile=exploit` lane, those ranked leads can seed `exploit_autopoc`, which generates lab-only proof plugins and verifies them through `exploit_runner`, `poc_validation`, and `exploit_policy`.

## Analyst Copilot Surfaces

### Explainability surface
- `reasoning_trail` and evidence lineage are preserved across findings, analyst Markdown, TUI, web viewer, and SARIF properties.
- This is where reviewers inspect *why* a finding was downgraded, upheld, or promoted.

### Analyst-in-the-loop channel
- MCP tools and `AIEDGE_FEEDBACK_DIR` are the supported override/hint path.
- Human hints are allowed to influence the next run; final ownership still stays with the analyst.

### Autonomous reasoning (future)
- SCOUT is **not** positioned as a fully autonomous exploit agent in v2.8.0.
- Multi-agent exploit chains, pair-grounded evaluation loops, and autonomous fuzz harness generation remain **Phase 2D / reviewer-eval lane** work.

## Pipeline (47 Stages)

```
Firmware --> Unpack --> Profile --> Inventory --> Ghidra --> Semantic Classification
    --> SBOM --> CVE Scan --> Reachability --> Endpoints --> Surfaces
    --> Enhanced Source --> C-Source ID --> Taint Propagation
    --> FP Verification --> Adversarial Triage
    --> Graph --> Attack Surface --> Findings
    --> LLM Triage --> LLM Synthesis --> Emulation --> [Fuzzing]
    --> PoC Refinement --> Chain Construction --> Exploitability Dossier
    --> Protocol Model --> Exploit State Machine --> Crash Replay --> Primitive Verifier
    --> Exploit Chain --> PoC --> Verification
```

Ghidra is auto-detected and enabled by default. Stages in `[brackets]` require optional external tools (AFL++/Docker).

## Benchmarks

### Tier 1 (Static, frozen baseline)

_Baseline: v2.6.1, 2026-04-17, fresh corpus refresh (`docs/carry_over_benchmark_v2.6.md`)_

- `1,123` firmware / `8` vendors / **98.8%** success rate
- `1,110` success / `4` partial / `9` fatal
- `3,531` findings / `146,943` CVE matches
- `1,089 / 1,110` successful runs produced nonzero CVE output

### Tier 2 (LLM-Adjudicated Adversarial Debate, GPT-5.3-Codex)

_Baseline: v2.3.0, 2026-04-09, claude-code driver (carry-over; pair-eval lane still pending)_

- `36` firmware / `9` vendors
- `2,430` findings debated → `2,412` downgraded + `18` maintained
- **LLM-adjudicated FPR reduction: 99.3%** | **pair-grounded FN/FP: pending reviewer eval lane**

### v2.6.0 Post-merge Real-Firmware Validation

_This section records post-release real-firmware validation runs, distinct from the carry-over corpus baselines above._

#### Validation target 1 — Netgear R7000 (codex driver, `--experimental-parallel 4`)

| Metric | v2.5.0 | v2.6.0 |
|---|---|---|
| `adversarial_triage` parse_failures | 0/100 | **0/100** (100 debated, 97 downgraded, 3 maintained) |
| `fp_verification` unverified | 0/100 | **0/100** (100 verified: 56 TP, 44 FP) |
| `reasoning_trail_count` (top-level findings) | N/A | **0/3** top-level / **100/100** at `adversarial_triage` + `fp_verification` artifacts ¹ |
| findings with `priority_score` | N/A | **3/3** (100% additive priority annotation) |
| `priority_bucket_counts` | N/A | `{critical: 0, high: 0, medium: 3, low: 0}` |
| category distribution | N/A | `{vulnerability: 1, pipeline_artifact: 2, misconfiguration: 0, unclassified: 0}` |
| `cve_scan` EPSS enriched | 23/23 | **0** (stage skipped — `sbom` landed partial and `cve_scan`/`reachability` skip on `sbom` dependency failure ²) |
| `--experimental-parallel 4` wall-clock | N/A | **~170 minutes** end-to-end across the registered pipeline (`fp_verification` dominant at 113 min; no sequential baseline for delta) |

¹ **v2.6.0 → v2.6.1 follow-up (commit `7b36274`)**: the top-level synthesis finding (`web.exec_sink_overlap`) now inherits matched downstream evidence lineage instead of relying only on the stage-level aggregate summary. Matching prefers run-relative binary path, falls back to binary SHA-256, and samples representative downstream trail entries deterministically so the synthesis finding reflects the alerts that actually informed it. This R7000 run reflects the v2.6.0 shipped behaviour.

² **v2.6.0 → v2.6.1 follow-up (commit `8e0bb82`)**: the R7000 extraction actually succeeded (1,664 files, 2,412 binaries scanned under `squashfs-root`), but the SBOM stage returned 0 components on this firmware due to a silent schema mismatch — `_collect_so_files_from_inventory` read `inventory.file_list` (a pre-v2.x key no longer emitted) and `_detect_from_binary_analysis` expected per-entry `string_hits` (replaced by `matched_symbols` in the current inventory schema). OpenWrt hid the bug because its opkg database alone contributes 100+ components. The fix makes both helpers walk `inventory.roots` directly and fall back to reading the binary file contents via a new `_extract_ascii_runs` helper. A clean re-run of just `SbomStage` on this R7000 run raises the component count from **0 to 4** (`curl 7.36.0` via binary read, plus `openssl 1.0.0` / `libz 1` / `libpthread 0` via `.so*` walking). Downstream `cve_scan` / `reachability` would then produce real CVE + EPSS numbers on a full pipeline re-run.

#### Validation target 2 — OpenWrt Archer C7 v5 (TP-Link, `--no-llm`)

| Metric | v2.6.0 |
|---|---|
| total findings | **3** |
| `reasoning_trail_count` | **0** _(no-llm: adversarial_triage and fp_verification are LLM-gated; trail is populated only when LLM stages run)_ |
| findings with `priority_score` | **3 / 3** _(100% — additive priority annotation succeeded for all findings)_ |
| `priority_bucket_counts` | `{critical: 0, high: 0, medium: 3, low: 0}` |
| category distribution | `{vulnerability: 1, pipeline_artifact: 2, misconfiguration: 0, unclassified: 0}` _(PR #7a 3-category ontology, 0% unclassified rate)_ |
| notable caveats | OpenWrt is `squashfs` ext4 root; binwalk extracted cleanly; `--no-llm` path skipped reasoning_trail generation as expected. Run completed end-to-end through `findings` stage. |

See [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for full version history and [`docs/scoring_calibration.md`](docs/scoring_calibration.md) for the two-score contract.

**Current benchmark contract**

- Archived benchmark bundles are now expected to be **run replicas**, not flattened JSON snapshots.
- Benchmark quality is reported in two layers:
  - **analysis rate** = pipeline completed (`success + partial`)
  - **analyst-ready rate** = archived bundle passes analyst/verifier checks and remains evidence-navigable
- `benchmark-results/legacy/tier2-llm-v2` is a **legacy snapshot**. It is useful for historical reference and re-evaluation, but it should not be used as the canonical analyst-readiness baseline.
- The current contract has been validated on a fresh single-sample run (`benchmark-results/tier2-single-fidelity`) where both analyst verifiers passed from the archived bundle.

**Current LLM quality behavior**

- `llm_triage` model routing: `<=10 haiku`, `11-50 sonnet`, `>50 or chain-backed opus`
- `llm_triage` retries with `sonnet` if a `haiku` call exits non-zero
- `llm_triage`, `semantic_classification`, `adversarial_triage`, and `fp_verification` now write `stages/<stage>/llm_trace/*.json`
- Parse failures are handled fail-closed: repaired when possible, otherwise reported as degraded/partial instead of silently treated as clean success
